#### Home Lab Construction, Configuration, and Domain Management
**Self-Initiated Project**  
Duration: [01, 2024] - [08, 2024]

**Objective:**  
To develop a comprehensive home lab on a personal laptop, focusing on network administration, cybersecurity, and systems management. The project expanded to include deploying windows Server 2017, configuring Active Directory, proceeded with the integration of Linux VMs for cybersecurity and system management learning, and the adoption of Okta with MFA for cutting-edge identity and access management. The newest venture involves building a personal website hosted within this infrastructure. The infrastructure then expanded by integrating a Windows 10 client VM within the domain governed by Windows Server 2017. The latest effort involved establishing Microsoft Windows Defender as the primary security control point for the network.


**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Domain Acquisition and Setup:**
  - Researched and purchased a domain name that aligns with the professional and personal branding goals for the project.
  - Configured DNS settings to point to the home lab server, facilitating access to internal services through the Internet under a recognizable domain.
  - Established an admin email tied to the chosen domain to manage all correspondence related to lab activities and services, enhancing the professional feel and operation of
    the lab.

- **Windows 10 Client VM Integration:
  - Installed Windows 10 on a VM as a client, further mimicking a real-world enterprise network scenario with diverse operating systems.
  - Ensured the Windows 10 client was successfully joined to the domain created on Windows Server 2017, demonstrating real enterprise network connectivity and domain
    management capabilities.
  - Configured network and security settings on the Windows 10 client to comply with policies set by the domain controller, illustrating effective policy enforcement across
    different OS platforms.

- **Windows Server 2017 Deployment:**
  - Orchestrated the installation and configuration of Windows Server 2017 within a VM, tailoring it to serve as the backbone of the lab environment.
  - Ensured the application of critical updates for maintaining system integrity and security posture.

- **Active Directory and Security Configuration:**
  - Deployed Active Directory to structure user accounts, groups, and policy management, mirroring enterprise-level network administration.
  - Instituted comprehensive security policies and firewall settings to safeguard the environment.

- **Integration of Linux Virtual Machines:**
  - Incorporated VMs for Kali Linux and Linux Mint, achieving a versatile platform for security exploration and administration tasks.

- **Okta Identity and Access Management with MFA:**
  - Implemented Okta to centralize identity management across all lab resources, enhancing security through multi-factor authentication.

- ** Linux VM Integration using VMware:**
  - Integrated Linux VMs (Kali Linux for cybersecurity tasks and Linux Mint for system management) leveraging VMware, ensuring robust performance and seamless operation
    within the lab.
  
- **Networking and Cross-Platform Integration:**
  - Optimized networking among VMs and ensured seamless interoperability between Windows and Linux systems, underpinning a cohesive lab infrastructure.

- **Personal Website Development:**
  - Currently embarking on designing and hosting a personal website within the lab environment, intending to showcase project accomplishments, technical blogs, and
    professional portfolio.
  - Evaluating web hosting software and content management systems (CMS) that can be efficiently managed within the lab's server infrastructure.

**Technologies Used:**
- Virtualization Technology: [Oracle Virtual machine / VMware]
- Operating Systems: [Windows 10, Windows Server 2017, Kali Linux, Linux Mint]
- Domain Management: [DNS Configuration, Admin Email Setup]
- Identity Management: [Okta with Multi-Factor Authentication]
- Windows Security: [Mircrosoft Windows defender]
- Web Technologies: [Pending Evaluation: HTML/CSS, python etc.]
- Networking: [Active Directory, Group Policy Management, DNS]

**Achievements:**
- Seamlessly transitioned the home lab to emulate a small enterprise by integrating a professionally managed domain and admin email, broadening my understanding of DNS and
  email management.
- Advanced my skill set in deploying and managing identity solutions (Okta with MFA), demonstrating competent security practices safeguarding resources and data.
- Initiated the development of a personal website, marking an expansion into web development and hosting, which will further diversify my technical proficiencies.
