#### Home Lab Construction, Configuration, and Domain Management
**Self-Initiated Project**  
Duration: [Month, Year] - [Month, Year]

**Objective:**  
To develop an intricate home lab on a personal laptop, focusing on network administration, cybersecurity, and seamless cross-platform management. The project expanded to include deploying Windows Server 2017, configuring Active Directory, integrating rigorous access rules, adding Linux VMs (Kali and Mint), implementing Okta for identity and access management with MFA, and establishing a domain with an admin email to simulate a small enterprise environment. The newest venture involves building a personal website hosted within this infrastructure.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Domain Acquisition and Setup:**
  - Researched and purchased a domain name that aligns with the professional and personal branding goals for the project.
  - Configured DNS settings to point to the home lab server, facilitating access to internal services through the Internet under a recognizable domain.
  - Established an admin email tied to the chosen domain to manage all correspondence related to lab activities and services, enhancing the professional feel and operation of the lab.

- **Windows Server 2017 Deployment:**
  - Orchestrated the installation and configuration of Windows Server 2017 within a VM, tailoring it to serve as the backbone of the lab environment.
  - Ensured the application of critical updates for maintaining system integrity and security posture.

- **Active Directory and Security Configuration:**
  - Deployed Active Directory to structure user accounts, groups, and policy management, mirroring enterprise-level network administration.
  - Instituted comprehensive security policies and firewall settings to safeguard the environment.

- **Integration of Linux Virtual Machines:**
  - Incorporated VMs for Kali Linux and Linux Mint, achieving a versatile platform for security exploration and administration tasks.

- **Okta Identity and Access Management with MFA:**
  - Implemented Okta to centralize identity management across all lab resources, enhancing security through multi-factor authentication.
  
- **Networking and Cross-Platform Integration:**
  - Optimized networking among VMs and ensured seamless interoperability between Windows and Linux systems, underpinning a cohesive lab infrastructure.

- **Personal Website Development:**
  - Currently embarking on designing and hosting a personal website within the lab environment, intending to showcase project accomplishments, technical blogs, and professional portfolio.
  - Evaluating web hosting software and content management systems (CMS) that can be efficiently managed within the lab's server infrastructure.

**Technologies Used:**
- Virtualization Technology: [Your Virtualization Software]
- Operating Systems: Windows Server 2017, Kali Linux, Linux Mint
- Domain Management: DNS Configuration, Admin Email Setup
- Identity Management: Okta with Multi-Factor Authentication
- Web Technologies: [Pending Evaluation: CMS, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, etc.]

**Achievements:**
- Seamlessly transitioned the home lab to emulate a small enterprise by integrating a professionally managed domain and admin email, broadening my understanding of DNS and email management.
- Advanced my skill set in deploying and managing identity solutions (Okta with MFA), demonstrating competent security practices safeguarding resources and data.
- Initiated the development of a personal website, marking an expansion into web development and hosting, which will further diversify my technical proficiencies.

**Reflection:**
This evolving project has significantly deepened my immersion into the complexities of IT infrastructure management, cybersecurity, and web development. By simulating an enterprise environment, I gained invaluable insights into the practical aspects of domain management, professional communication, and secure system administration. The upcoming website project presents an exciting opportunity to encapsulate and display the knowledge and skills acquired through this comprehensive home lab experience, illustrating the intersection of technical expertise and creative expression in the digital realm.
